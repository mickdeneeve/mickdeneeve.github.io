<b>Abstract </b>Larson's musical forces of gravity, magnetism and inertia link music to metaphors of physical motion, while Schlenker's music semantics is also based on certain associations with the physical world. This thesis investigates the connection between the two approaches, as well as how Larson's forces might be adapted and/or extended. The aim is to incorporate Larson's forces into a more formal treatment of music semantics than Schlenker's, but with the same objective: to be able to say when a denotation is true of a musical expression.
