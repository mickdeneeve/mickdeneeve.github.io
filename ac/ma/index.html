<b>Abstract </b>Larson's theory of musical forces links music to metaphors of
physical motion, while Schlenker's music semantics is also based on certain
associations with the physical world. This thesis investigates the connection
between the two approaches. The aim is to incorporate Larson's forces into
a formal treatment of music semantics, with Schlenker's objective of being
able to say when a denotation is true of a musical expression. This is a
computational effort to the extent that logic programs are provided which
implement part of the resulting framework.
