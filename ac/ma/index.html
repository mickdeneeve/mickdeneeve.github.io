<b>Abstract </b>Larson's musical forces of gravity, magnetism and inertia link music to metaphors of physical motion, while Schlenker's music semantics is based on similar associations with the physical world. This thesis investigates the connection between the two approaches, as well as how Larson's forces might be adapted and/or extended. In particular, magnetism seems dubious in that it treats the stable triad tones as equivalent, which seems problematic for modeling cadential resolution. Inertia on the other hand is only vaguely specified in terms of contination of a pattern, but this suggests it might be useful for modeling thematic development. The aim is to incorporate Larson's forces into a more formal treatment of music semantics than Schlenker's, but with the same objective: to be able to say when a denotation is true of a musical expression.
