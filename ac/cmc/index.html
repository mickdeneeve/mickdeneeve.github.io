<b>Abstract </b>  Shagrir's semantic-computational perspective restricts the notion of computation to brains and familiar computing devices, but only
demonstrably applies to simple actions and not to higher cognition. This
is harder to capture in terms of precise functionality and cannot generally
be claimed to inherit a logical semantics, leading to a gap in the semantic
perspective. But another, linguistic sense of &nbsp'semantics' can be applied to
Dreyfus's post-logicist higher cognition view of expertise, by considering
it from Clark's perspective of the brain as a Bayesian prediction machine,
augmented with previous work by Clark on language as an artefact. That
imports semantics into higher, not strictly linguistic or logicist cognition,
and results in an account of language as a learning foundation that persists
to avoid overfitting.
